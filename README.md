User Dashboard with AngularJS
===============

This single page application was inspired by Dan Wahlin’s Customer Manager Application - http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/learning-angularjs-by-example-the-customer-manager-application.

#### Key Features:

* Responsive design

* A complete application with create, update and delete functions

* Using factories and services as re-useable data services

* Custom filters for filtering user and order data

* Showing custom modal dialogs with a re-useable service, integrated with Angular UI Bootstrap

* Form validation using AngularJS

* A custom routing mechanism that allows a controller & template to be downloaded dynamically "on the fly" and provides a standard convention for controller and view names

* Using local storage to manipulate data
